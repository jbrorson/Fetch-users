# Fetching random user data

## About this project

This project was created in order to show case my skills as a frontend developer. I got an assigment to setup a page, using React and TypeScript and to fetch data from the [Ramdom User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) and display the data in a good looking way.

I'm usign TypeScript to get hold of types and I'm using plain CSS to style the page.
